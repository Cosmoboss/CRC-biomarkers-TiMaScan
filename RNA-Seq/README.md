# RNA-Seq <p1>

In this folder are all the datasets and codes that were used to process RNA-Seq data.
Do note that the codes do not process all the datasets at once.
However, they are usable for all datasets if you change a few parameters which differ per dataset.

The datasets and codes listed are:

* GSE74369_countfiles
* GSE146009_countfiles
* Process_RNA_Seq
  * Processes the count files from GSE74369
* ComBat-Seq
  * The (unsuccessful) attempt at merging the count files from both studies
