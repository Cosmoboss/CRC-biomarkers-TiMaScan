There's multiple branches with code, input and output files.
* Microarray
  * contains code for processing microarray data
* RNA-Seq
  * Contains code and processed count files for RNA-Seq data that is used in the code
* Proteomics
  * Contains code and processed proteomics data that is used within the code
* TCGA
  * Contains all processing code for TCGA data and steps
* Single-cell
  * Contains code for processing single-cell data and an additional google drive link to already pre-processed seurat objects
* Supplementary_files
  * Contains a file for secreted proteins, macrophage and monocyte specific genes and an excel sheet for where to download data for the project.
