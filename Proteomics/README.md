# Proteomics <p1>

In this folder are all the codes and supplementary files for processing proteomics

The codes lister are:

* Proteomics_read_and_get_gene_names
  * Reads in the proteinGroups.txt files to get out the gene names
* Proteomics_filter_spectral_counts
  * Reads in and filters the spectral count files from TCGA

Furthermore, the .xml files for MaxQuant and the result files (proteinGroups) are added for each study that was processed.
In addition, the spectral count files are also added
